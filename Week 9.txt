Week 8 (digital wallets) I was absent so see this topic
Today's topic:
Multi Sig
Online wallet

On-Chain Example
Scenario: Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob using the Bitcoin blockchain.

Steps:
Alice initiates a transaction from her wallet to send 1 BTC to Bob's wallet address.

The transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network.

Miners validate the transaction and add it to a new block.

Once the block is confirmed, the transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

Bob can see the transaction publicly, and the funds are now his.

✅ Benefits: Trustless, secure, publicly verifiable.
⏳ Downside: Slower and can incur higher transaction fees.

🔄 Off-Chain Example
Scenario: Alice and Bob use a payment channel (like the Lightning Network on Bitcoin) or just agree informally.

Example 1: Using a Payment Channel
Alice and Bob open a payment channel by locking up 2 BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain (initial on-chain step).

Over time, Alice sends Bob 1 BTC through signed off-chain transactions.

These transactions aren’t broadcast to the blockchain.

When they’re done, they close the channel, and the final balances (e.g., Alice: 1 BTC, Bob: 1 BTC) are settled on-chain.

Example 2: Informal/Trusted Party
Alice says to Bob: “I’ll give you 1 BTC tomorrow for your help today.”

They don’t record anything on the blockchain, but they agree on it off-chain.

Later, Alice may settle it by sending BTC on-chain — or they may keep it informal.

⚡ Benefits: Faster, cheaper, private.
⚠️ Downside: Requires trust (unless using tech like Lightning), and is not immediately final or recorded on the blockchain.


On-Chain vs Off-Chain in Pakistan (Alice & Bob Style)
🔗 On-Chain Transaction (Crypto Wallet to Wallet)
Scenario:
Alice lives in Lahore, Bob in Karachi.

Both use self-custody wallets (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc).

Steps:
Alice sends USDT or BTC from her wallet directly to Bob’s wallet address.

The transaction is broadcast to the blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Tron, etc).

Miners/validators confirm it.

Bob sees the funds in his wallet.

✅ Pros:

Decentralized, no middleman.

Borderless and direct.

⚠️ Cons:

Requires basic blockchain knowledge.

Can incur network fees.

Subject to volatility and risk of scams.

🎯 Common Use Cases in Pakistan:

Freelancers receiving crypto from global clients.

Peer-to-peer (P2P) investments.

Buying goods/services via crypto where accepted.

🔄 Off-Chain Transaction (Inside Exchanges or P2P Apps)
Option 1: Using Centralized Exchanges (e.g., Binance)
Alice and Bob both have Binance accounts.

Alice sends 100 USDT to Bob through Binance internal transfer (email or UID).

Binance just updates the ledger — no blockchain interaction.

✅ Fast and free
⚠️ Requires trust in Binance

Option 2: Local P2P Marketplaces (Binance P2P, LocalBitcoins, etc)
Bob posts a USDT buy ad on Binance P2P.

Alice agrees to sell and transfers USDT on-chain to Binance P2P escrow.

Bob pays Alice via bank transfer or JazzCash/EasyPaisa (this part is off-chain fiat).

Once confirmed, Binance releases crypto to Bob.

🪙 Off-chain = PKR payment
🔗 On-chain = crypto release from escrow

🧠 Hybrid Flow in Real Life (Common in Pakistan)
Step-by-step:

Bob buys USDT from Binance P2P (pays PKR via bank).

He sends USDT to Alice’s wallet (on-chain).

Alice then off-ramps USDT back into PKR via another P2P trade.

This means:

PKR ↔️ Crypto is off-chain (done via fiat transfer).

Crypto ↔️ Crypto can be on-chain (wallets) or off-chain (inside exchange).

🇵🇰 Regulation Note:
Crypto isn’t fully regulated or banned, but SBP (State Bank of Pakistan) has warned against its use.

P2P and crypto use is common but informal.

Most people use Binance, OKX, or Trust Wallet.

People often use VPNs, Telegram/WhatsApp groups, or local OTC agents.



OK what if the state bank is on chain and local banks are on chain ????
On-Chain (SBP Level)
This is when funds actually move across the core national settlement system, controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan.

Example:
Alice has an account at HBL, Bob has an account at UBL.

Alice sends PKR 100,000 to Bob.

Since they’re in different banks, the transaction must go through SBP’s RTGS system (Raast or PRISM).

What happens:
HBL asks SBP to settle the amount with UBL.

SBP debits HBL’s account and credits UBL’s account — this is the on-chain settlement.

UBL then credits Bob's account.

✅ Trusted, centralized ledger
⏳ Slower, but final
📖 Officially recorded at national level

🔄 Off-Chain (Local Bank Level)
This is when the transaction happens inside the same bank, so SBP doesn't need to be involved.

Example:
Alice and Bob both use Meezan Bank.

Alice sends Bob PKR 50,000.

What happens:
Meezan simply updates its internal ledger:

Alice’s account is debited.

Bob’s account is credited.

No funds need to move through SBP.

It’s faster, cheaper, and done entirely off-chain (i.e., off-SBP).

✅ Fast & free
⚠️ Not reflected on SBP ledger instantly

Issues with on chain and off chain implementations
1. we would need to create a node with many sub nodes with its own public and private key
2. Issue with integrity (considering an off chain implementation) any one can change given correct credentials.
3. In case of assets transfer of owner ship mechanisms would be required.

All wallets provide bank-like services

 In Crypto: Does Off-Chain Eventually Register On-Chain?
✅ Sometimes — If it needs final settlement.
Example 1: Lightning Network (Bitcoin)
Alice and Bob exchange BTC off-chain via a payment channel.

When they're done, the final balance is recorded on-chain when the channel closes.

So yes — it eventually hits the blockchain.

Example 2: Binance Internal Transfer
Alice sends USDT to Bob inside Binance.

That transaction stays off-chain unless:

Bob withdraws to an external wallet → goes on-chain.

Binance itself audits or moves funds → partial on-chain movement.

So no — it may never touch the chain unless someone exits the exchange.

🏛️ In the Pakistan Analogy (SBP = Chain, Local Banks = Off-Chain)
✅ Yes — if money moves between banks, SBP will see it.
Example:
Alice sends PKR 100,000 from HBL to UBL.

Initially:

HBL deducts the amount from Alice’s account (off-chain).

UBL adds it to Bob’s (off-chain).

But: HBL and UBL must settle with each other via SBP's RTGS/PRISM.

That movement between banks is recorded at the SBP (on-chain).

So yes — off-chain activity between banks eventually settles on-chain.

❌ No — if money stays within the same bank.
Alice → Bob both in Meezan Bank: SBP never sees it.

It’s fully off-chain and may never hit the central ledger unless required for audit or compliance.
