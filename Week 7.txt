Locking script <Redeem script>
OP_DUP OP_HASH160<Bob"s Public Key Hash>
OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Unlocking Script
<Bob's Signature><Bob's Public Key>

First unlock then lock
Works like a stack

hash of public key 
hash of signature
bob's public key
bob's sig

Escrow transaction:
Image if two people have an agreement for a transaction but for some reason there is a conflict and no one is authorizing the transaction.
A third party service would resolve this conflict keeping the trust intact.

Script of Escrow <Locking script/Redeem script>
OP_2(Two signatures) <Alice_PublicKey>
<Bob_PublicKey>
<Charlie_PublicKey> OP_3(three signatures) (See if the locking script has three public keys)
OP_CHECKMULTISIG


Green Address Payment in Bitcoin
A green address is a bitcoin transactioin method where a trusted third party such as an exchange or wallet provider co-signs transactions,
allowing recipicants to accept them instantly, even before they are confirmed on the  blockchain.

Locking script-Funds locked in green address
OP_2 <Alice_PublicKey><Provider_PublicKey> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG

OP_2 requires 2 valid signatures to spend Bitcoin
<Alice_PublicKey>,<Provider_PublicKey> -> Two available public key.
OP_2 -> exactly two public keys are involbed
OP_CHECKMULTISIG -> Ensures both alice and green address signatures are verified via their hash to existing hash
