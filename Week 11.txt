Bitcoin and anonymity
Privacy should be maintained (Information hiding) {anonymity}

What is meant by anonymity?
A: Refers to the ability of users to participate in transactions (in the context of blockchain)
without revealing their real-world identities.
Achieved via cryptographic addresses (Wallet addresses).

Mixer in blockchain
In the context of blockchain, a mixer (also known as a tumbler) is a privacy-enhancing tool that 
helps obfuscate the traceability of cryptocurrency transactions.


A mixer is a service (centralized or decentralized) that breaks the on-chain link between the sender 
and the recipient of crypto by mixing coins from many users. After mixing, users receive different coins 
of the same value (minus a small fee), making it difficult to trace where the funds originally came from.

How Does It Work?
Centralized Mixers:
Users deposit their crypto (e.g., BTC) into a pool controlled by the service.

After some time and mixing, they withdraw the same amount (minus a fee) from the pool, but not the exact coins they deposited.

The mixer keeps logs (which could be subpoenaed or leaked), so not completely trustless.

Decentralized Mixers:
Use smart contracts or cryptographic techniques (like Zero-Knowledge proofs or CoinJoin) to mix funds without needing a trusted party.

Examples:

CoinJoin: Multiple users combine their transactions into a single transaction.

Tornado Cash (Ethereum): Uses zk-SNARKs to allow users to withdraw funds to a new address, with no on-chain link.

üõ°Ô∏è Why Use a Mixer?
Privacy: Protect transaction history and wallet balances from being traced.

Anonymity: Useful for individuals who don't want their purchases, donations, or income to be publicly traceable.

Security: Reduces the risk of being targeted due to wealth being visible on-chain.

‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Concerns
Legitimate Privacy Tool: For people who care about financial privacy.

Misuse: Mixers are often associated with money laundering, ransomware, and other illicit activities.

Governments have sanctioned some mixers (e.g., Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022).

üöÄ Examples of Mixers
Mixer Type	Example	Platform	Status
Centralized	Bitcoin Fog	Bitcoin	Seized
Decentralized	Tornado Cash	Ethereum	Sanctioned
CoinJoin-Based	Wasabi Wallet	Bitcoin	Active (regulated)
CoinJoin-Based	Samourai Wallet	Bitcoin	Active


One point to note:
Anonymity = pseudoymity + unlinkability
Different interactions of the same user with the system should not be linkable with each other.
