Usecase-1:
Bitcoin's consensus algorithm relies on cryptographic security and decentralized validation to prevent malicious
activities, 

Steps:
1. Every bitcoin transaction requires a valid digital signature from the rightful owner.
2. Even if Alice is chosen to propose the next block, she cannot forge another user's signature.

Mitigates Denial of service attacks:
1. Blocks proposers Rotates Randomly.
    a. Alice might reduce to incluude Bob's transactions in her proposed block.
    b. However, the next block proposer is Randomly selected, meaning Bob's transaction
       will be included by another honest role.
2. Network Redundancy Prevents Censorship.
    a. Multiple node validate transactions.
    b. Even if alice ignores Bob's transaction it will remain in the pool until a fair
       minner includes it.
3. transaction Persistence Ensures Inclusion.


Double Spending Attack (Prevention)
Prevent a node from making the same block being added in the chain. 
(Happens at the verification level).
We verify the coin chain (Every unique coin chain)
Preventing duplicates of coin existing in the chain.

(SEE 51% attack)

Block Reward Mechanism:
Gets some kind of a reward through a special coin-creation transaction.

Bitcoin Halving Process:
1. Initially, the block reward was 50BTC, but it halves every 210,000 block (~4 years)
2. The reward was 25BTC at the time of writting(2013) currently 6.25 BTC as of 2024, plus transaction fee
3. This ensures a finite total supply of 21 million bitcoin.
4. The reward is assigned to an address choosen by the miner, usually their own.

What are bitcoin pools?
Bitcoin mining pools are groups of miners who collaborate to solve blocks and share the rewards proportionally based on their contributed computing power. 
Instead of mining solo, where only the miner who solves the block gets the reward, pools allow participants to earn more consistent payouts by 
pooling their computational resources.

How Bitcoin Mining Pools Work
Pooling Resources – Miners contribute their hashing power to a central pool.
Collective Mining – The pool coordinates mining efforts and distributes computational work.
Block Discovery – If the pool successfully mines a block, it receives the Bitcoin block reward (currently 6.25 BTC as of 2024, plus transaction fees).
Payout Distribution – The reward is divided among pool members based on their contributed computing power.
Types of Bitcoin Mining Pools
Pay-per-Share (PPS) – Miners receive a fixed payout for each share submitted, regardless of whether the pool finds a block.
Proportional – Rewards are distributed proportionally based on each miner's contributed work after a block is found.
Pay-per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) – Similar to proportional but considers only the last N shares submitted before a block is found.
Solo Mining Pools – Pool where miners still mine independently but combine efforts to increase chances of finding a block.
Popular Bitcoin Mining Pools
F2Pool – One of the largest pools globally.
Antpool – Operated by Bitmain, a leading mining hardware manufacturer.
Slush Pool – One of the first Bitcoin mining pools.
BTC.com – A major mining pool offering multiple payout methods.
ViaBTC – Offers both PPS and PPLNS options.
Advantages of Mining Pools
✅ Steady Income – Regular payouts instead of waiting to win a block. 
✅ Reduced Variance – Less dependency on luck compared to solo mining. 
✅ Lower Costs – Miners with limited resources can still participate in Bitcoin mining.

Disadvantages of Mining Pools
❌ Pool Fees – Most pools charge a percentage of the earnings. 
❌ Centralization Risks – Large pools could potentially influence Bitcoin's network. 
❌ Lower Individual Rewards – Compared to solo mining, rewards are shared.
