Consensus algorithm
1.New transactions are broadcast to all nodes
2. Each node collects new transactions into a block
3. In each round a random node gets to broadcast its block

4. Other nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid (unspent, valid signatures)

5. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by including its hash in the next block they create

Consensus algorithms are essential for blockchain networks as they ensure all participants agree on the 
current state of the distributed ledger. Here are the most common consensus algorithms used in blockchain:

1. Proof of Work (PoW)
Used by: Bitcoin, Ethereum (before ETH 2.0)
How it Works: Miners solve complex cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks.
Pros: Secure and decentralized.
Cons: High energy consumption, slower transaction speed.

2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
Used by: Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Solana
How it Works: Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake as collateral.
Pros: Energy efficient, faster transactions.
Cons: Wealthier participants have more influence.

Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus Algorithm
Overview
Proof of Work (PoW) is the original consensus algorithm used in blockchain technology, 
introduced by Bitcoin in 2009. It is designed to secure the network by requiring participants (miners)
 to solve complex mathematical problems before adding a block to the blockchain.

How Proof of Work Works
Transaction Pool

Users broadcast transactions to the network.
Transactions are collected into a block by miners.
Cryptographic Puzzle (Mining)

Miners compete to solve a complex hash puzzle using computational power.
The puzzle involves finding a nonce (random number) that, when combined with the block's data and passed
 through a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 for Bitcoin), produces a hash that meets the network‚Äôs difficulty target.
Proof Verification

Once a miner finds a valid solution, they broadcast it to the network.
Other nodes verify the solution quickly (easy to verify, hard to solve).
Block Addition & Reward

If verified, the new block is added to the blockchain.
The winning miner receives a block reward (e.g., Bitcoin rewards) and transaction fees.
Difficulty Adjustment

The network adjusts the mining difficulty periodically (every 2016 blocks in Bitcoin) to maintain a constant block time 
(10 minutes for Bitcoin).
Key Features of PoW
‚úî Security: Difficult to alter past transactions (requires re-mining all subsequent blocks).
‚úî Decentralization: Any node with computational power can participate.
‚úî Sybil Attack Resistance: Attackers need enormous computing power to control the network.

Disadvantages of PoW
‚ùå High Energy Consumption: Mining requires massive amounts of electricity.
‚ùå Centralization Risk: Large mining pools dominate, reducing decentralization.
‚ùå Scalability Issues: Slow transaction processing compared to newer consensus mechanisms.

Examples of PoW-Based Blockchains
üîπ Bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äì Uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
üîπ Ethereum (ETH) ‚Äì Used PoW until it transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) in Ethereum 2.0.
üîπ Litecoin (LTC) ‚Äì Uses Scrypt hashing algorithm for faster block generation.
üîπ Dogecoin (DOGE) ‚Äì Initially a joke but uses PoW similar to Litecoin.

51% Attack: The Security Risk
If a single entity controls more than 50% of the network's computational power, they can:

Modify transaction history.
Prevent new transactions from being confirmed.
Double-spend coins.
However, in large networks like Bitcoin, such an attack is economically unfeasible due to the enormous mining cost.

Conclusion
Proof of Work remains one of the most secure blockchain consensus mechanisms but is increasingly being replaced by more 
energy-efficient alternatives like Proof of Stake (PoS) due to its high computational and energy costs.


Cryptographic Nonce: Definition & Use in Proof of Work (PoW)
A cryptographic nonce is a random or pseudo-random number used only once in cryptographic operations. In blockchain and Proof of Work (PoW) systems, the nonce is a crucial component in mining.

Nonce in Proof of Work (PoW)
In PoW, the nonce is a variable that miners change repeatedly while attempting to find a valid block hash that meets the network‚Äôs difficulty target.

Process of Finding a Valid Nonce
Block Data Preparation

Miners take the block's transactions and metadata (previous block hash, timestamp, Merkle root, etc.).
A nonce is added to the block header as a variable.
Hashing Attempt

Miners hash the entire block header (including the nonce) using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256 for Bitcoin).
The result is a block hash.
Difficulty Check

If the block hash is below the difficulty target (i.e., it has a required number of leading zeros), the block is valid.
If not, the miner increments the nonce and tries again.
Winning the Block

The first miner to find a valid nonce broadcasts the new block to the network.
Other nodes verify the solution, and if correct, the block is added to the blockchain.
The successful miner is rewarded with a block reward + transaction fees.
Example: Bitcoin Nonce Calculation
Bitcoin uses SHA-256 as its hashing function.

Block Header Fields:
Previous Block Hash
Merkle Root (transactions)
Timestamp
Nonce (changing value)
Difficulty Target

unless there are six confirmations the block won't be added in the chain.
